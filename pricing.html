                Pricings can vary depending on the type and size of a Cloud Service Provider.

                <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    Public Cloud provides a wide range of services, such as computing, networking, storage, and more. It is often used by businesses and individuals who require flexible and scalable cloud services.

                <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    Private Cloud is where you own and/or lease your own hardware directly and have it located in your own data center. It provides more security and control over your data.

                <h3>Advantages of Public Cloud</h3>

                <p>
                    The advantages to Public Clouds include: Scalability, Reliability, and its Cost-Effectiveness. 
                    The scale can easily be adjusted to fit what you are needing. 
                    It is Reliable as most Public Cloud Services have backups, redundancy, and robust disaster recovery capabilities.

                <h3>Advantages of Private Cloud</h3>

                <p>
                    The advantages to Private Clouds include: Security, Control, and Cost Predictability.
                    Since you would be owning the hardware, you are able to have more control over it than if it was a Public Cloud.
                    You are also able to have your hardware isolated, which greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
                    The cost will be higher with Private Clouds compared to Public Clouds, but, you will be able to predict the future costs monthly costs, unlike where the Public Clouds are unpredictable as traffic can vary.
