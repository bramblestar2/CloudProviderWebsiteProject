Need to rebuild the css at some point to make everything smoother and less messy.
Right now theres some issues with media queries as i dont have any specific numbers im using for them.
When rebuilding the css, build initially for extra small devices, then have everything else be in media queries for larger sizes.
Potentially move layouts and styles into separate files for clarity.

Media Queries

- Extra Small Devices
  - Max Width 600px
- Small Devices
  - Min Width 600px
- Medium Devices
  - Min Width 768px
- Large Devices
  - Min Width 992px
- Extra Large Devices
  - Min Width 1200px
