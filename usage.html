                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud services are used in a wide range of everyday tasks: email, file storage, streaming media,
                    hosting websites and applications, running virtual machines, training artificial intelligence
                    models, and much more. Both public and private clouds play important roles in modern computing.

                <h3>Public Cloud Use Cases</h3>
                <p>
                    Public cloud services are delivered over the internet by providers such as Amazon Web Services,
                    Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Individuals and organizations rent resources rather than
                    owning the hardware.
                </p>
                <p>Common public cloud uses include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email hosting</strong> – services like Gmail and Outlook.com</li>
                    <li><strong>File storage &amp; sharing</strong> – Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive</li>
                    <li><strong>Streaming services</strong> – platforms such as YouTube and Netflix run on cloud
                        infrastructure</li>
                    <li><strong>Web hosting</strong> – websites and web apps hosted on cloud servers</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual machines</strong> – on-demand servers for development, testing, or production
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI and machine learning</strong> – cloud-based tools for training and running models
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Private Cloud Use Cases</h3>
                <p>
                    A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted in the organization’s own
                    data center or managed by a third party, but the hardware and resources are not shared with the
                    general public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private clouds offer more control and can be customized to meet specific security, compliance, and
                    performance requirements. Technologies from vendors such as VMware and Red Hat are often used to
                    build private cloud environments.
                </p>
                <p>Common private cloud use cases include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secure data storage</strong> for sensitive or regulated information</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)</strong> – providing remote desktops to employees
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Internal business applications</strong> that must stay on-premises</li>
                    <li><strong>Development and testing environments</strong> with strict access controls</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Choosing Between Public and Private Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    Public clouds are typically chosen for flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency. They are ideal
                    when workloads change frequently, when you need to reach users around the world, or when you want to
                    avoid managing physical infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private clouds are preferred when data security, compliance, or strict performance requirements are
                    the top priority. Organizations can customize their environment and maintain full control over how
                    systems are configured and accessed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many organizations combine both approaches in a <strong>hybrid cloud</strong> model, keeping some
                    workloads in a private cloud while using public cloud services for others. This allows them to
                    balance control, cost, and flexibility.
