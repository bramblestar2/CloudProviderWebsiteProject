                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing didn’t appear overnight. It grew out of earlier ideas about sharing computing power,
                    connecting machines over long distances, and delivering software through the internet. Over time,
                    those ideas evolved into the large-scale cloud platforms we use today.

                <h3>Early Foundations: Mainframe and Grid Computing</h3>
                <p>
                    Before modern cloud computing existed, organizations relied on large mainframe computers and, later,
                    grid computing systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Mainframes</strong> (from the 1960s onward) allowed many users to connect to a single
                    powerful
                    computer at the same time. Users typically worked on “dumb terminals” that depended entirely on the
                    central machine. This was an early example of shared computing resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Grid computing</strong> (1990s–early 2000s) connected clusters of computers across multiple
                    locations so they could work together on massive problems. These grids were especially useful for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Climate and weather modeling</li>
                    <li>Particle physics experiments</li>
                    <li>Large-scale engineering simulations</li>
                    <li>Complex mathematical calculations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The idea of pooling distributed resources in grid computing directly influenced how cloud computing
                    would later be designed.

                <h3>Birth of Modern Cloud Computing (2000–2006)</h3>
                <p>
                    As the internet matured, companies realized they could provide computing resources over the web
                    instead
                    of forcing every business to buy and maintain its own servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1999, Salesforce helped popularize the idea of
                    <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> by delivering customer relationship management (CRM)
                    software through a web browser. Customers didn’t have to install software locally or manage their
                    own
                    infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early 2000s, Amazon began turning its internal infrastructure into products. In 2002, Amazon
                    Web
                    Services (AWS) launched some early tools, and in 2006, AWS released
                    <strong>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</strong>. EC2 allowed users to rent virtual machines on demand,
                    marking the beginning of widely used
                    <strong>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This shift was revolutionary: instead of buying physical servers, businesses could pay only for the
                    computing power and storage they needed.

                <h3>The Big Cloud Providers Enter the Scene</h3>
                <p>
                    After AWS proved that cloud computing could work at scale, other major technology companies entered
                    the
                    market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> grew out of Google’s experience running one of the
                    world’s largest search engines. Google offered cloud storage, virtual machines, and powerful
                    analytics
                    tools built on its internal technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> officially launched around 2010. It quickly became popular with
                    organizations already using Windows Server, SQL Server, and Active Directory. Azure made it easier
                    for
                    traditional businesses to move their existing applications into the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other companies, such as IBM and Oracle, also introduced cloud platforms focused on large
                    enterprises
                    with specific performance, compliance, and database needs.

                <h3>Rise of New Cloud Services (2010s)</h3>
                <p>
                    As competition increased, cloud providers expanded far beyond simple virtual machines and storage.
                    They introduced new service models and tools to simplify development and operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong> offerings gave developers ready-made environments for
                    building and deploying applications without managing the underlying servers. This reduced the
                    complexity of setting up databases, runtimes, and web servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)</strong>, also known as serverless computing, went even
                    further.
                    Services like AWS Lambda (introduced in 2014) let developers run small pieces of code in response to
                    events, without provisioning or managing any servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cloud providers also launched:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managed databases (SQL and NoSQL)</li>
                    <li>Big data analytics platforms</li>
                    <li>Machine learning and AI services</li>
                    <li>Security, monitoring, and logging tools</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By the late 2010s, many everyday services—such as streaming video, social media, online gaming, and
                    mobile apps—were heavily dependent on cloud infrastructure.

            <article class="section-info">
                <h3>Modern Era (2020s–Today): Multi-Cloud and Global Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, cloud computing is the backbone of much of the internet and modern business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many organizations use a <strong>multi-cloud</strong> strategy, combining services from multiple
                    providers (for example, AWS and Azure together) to increase reliability, avoid vendor lock-in, and
                    take advantage of each platform’s strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hybrid cloud</strong> models are also common. In a hybrid setup, a company might keep some
                    sensitive systems on-premises in its own data centers while using public cloud services for other
                    workloads. This approach balances control, security, and flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Edge computing</strong> has emerged as another important trend. Instead of running all
                    processing in a distant data center, some workloads run closer to users or devices to reduce
                    latency.
                    This is especially important for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, real-time applications, and
                    autonomous systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, cloud providers now offer powerful environments for
                    <strong>artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong>, including access to specialized
                    hardware
                    like GPUs and TPUs. These tools make it possible to train and deploy advanced models at a scale that
                    would be difficult for most organizations to achieve on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From mainframes and grid computing to global-scale cloud platforms, the history of cloud service
                    providers shows a steady move toward more shared, flexible, and on-demand computing. That evolution
                    continues today as new technologies and services are built on top of the cloud.
