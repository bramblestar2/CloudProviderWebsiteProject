    <main>

        <p>Before Cloud Computing was invented, we had its predecessor, Grid Computing. Grid Computing was made up of a
            cluster of machines that were connected to several locations. </p>
        <p>They were mainly used by Scientists and Engineers
            at the time, since they needed the extra computation power to complete and solve complex mathematical or
            scientific problems.</p>
        <p>When the internet continued to grow, in 2006, the first publicly used Cloud Service
            Provider was made, a IaaS hosted by Amazons Web Services (AWS). It helped businesses to manage the costs of
            having to invest in physical machines and maintain their own servers.</p>
        <p>Soon after the creation of AWS, Google
            followed along with Google Cloud, with Microsoft coming along with Microsoft Azure. After some time, these
            services would build up their tools, offering machine learning, analytics, and security solutions.</p>
